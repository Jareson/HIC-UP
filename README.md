# HIC-UP
Overview: <br/>
  HIC-UP is a inventory control app meant for household usage. Many of us have busy lives, and while organizing time to keep track of it day to day is responsible, it isnâ€™t always reliable. HIC-UP is designed to make the process of tracking your household stock fast and easy. HIC-UP allows users to create a database of their household items, and quickly add or remove them in 3-5 taps. Users can create a family database that everyone in their house can utilize in order to seamlessly track the household inventory. Alongside this, the app would return notifications based on stock set by the head of the household, and assist in creating grocery lists.

Features: <br/>
  -User login: Allow connectivity to Google drive and link users in a family via family name<br/>
  -Minimalist UI: Easily add and remove from database in few actions<br/>
  -Extended customization features: Allow editing of items to add categories, add missing information, and set routine               notifications. Allow adding of the price of an item at purchase, as well as the place purchased. Stamp the update date of this as the current date the user updated the price. If the item is bought somewhere at a lower price, update the location with the newest low price purchase location to reflect in the database<br/>
  -Google Sheets Database: Allow users to export to a Google sheets database to allow easy review of the household stock<br/>
  -Grocery List Helper: Aid users in creating a grocery list based on routine purchases, low stock, and stock budget reminders <br/>

What you'll have to learn: <br/>
  I will be learning how to use Xamarin in order to produce an Android app over Visual Studio through C#. This will also result in learing XAML and XML to create the UIs for the app, as well as Android SDK to understand how the architecture works. I intend to learn and utilize Javascript if possible, but that may not be immediately valuable.
