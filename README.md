# HIC-UP
Overview: 
  HIC-UP is a inventory control app meant for household usage. Many of us have busy lives, and while organizing time to keep track of it day to day is responsible, it isnâ€™t always reliable. HIC-UP is designed to make the process of tracking your household stock fast and easy. HIC-UP allows users to create a database of their household items, and quickly add or remove them in 3-5 taps. Users can create a family database that everyone in their house can utilize in order to seamlessly track the household inventory. Alongside this, the app would return notifications based on stock set by the head of the household, and assist in creating grocery lists.

Features:     
  -User login: Allow connectivity to Google drive and link users in a family via family name
  
  -Minimalist UI: Easily add and remove from database in few actions
  
  -Extended customization features: Allow editing of items to add categories, add missing information, and set routine               notifications. Allow adding of the price of an item at purchase, as well as the place purchased. Stamp the update date of this as the current date the user updated the price. If the item is bought somewhere at a lower price, update the location with the newest low price purchase location to reflect in the database
  
  -Google Sheets Database: Allow users to export to a Google sheets database to allow easy review of the household stock
  
  -Grocery List Helper: Aid users in creating a grocery list based on routine purchases, low stock, and stock budget reminders

What you'll have to learn: 
  I will have to learn JavaScript and the Google sheets API in order produce readable and user friendly databases. They will not be the core database, they will be an extraction from the SQL database created in the app, but I want it to create a database in Sheets that is easy to read, and even color coded if possible. JavaScript will mostly be used within some of the interactions of the UI, as I want this to be an Android app.
